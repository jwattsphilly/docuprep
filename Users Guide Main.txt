Timers:
	On the bottom left-hand corner of the window, you will see two timers.
	When the first timer, labeled "next check in," reaches 0, the inbound folders set in Settings
	are searched for text files containing the necessary information to merge two PDF files.  The
	names of these text files are displayed in the white box underneath "Files Waiting to be
	Processed."  The PDF files are then automatically merged and copied to the four outbound
	folders.
	When the second timer, labeled "next report in," reaches 0, the application reports its status
	to the database set in Settings.
