Settings Help:

Text Fields:
	There are a total of 11 text fields included in the Settings application.  The types and 
	descriptions of these fields are as follows:
	
	Inbound Folders:
		Pathnames to the folders to search for the .txt files containing the merge information.  Any
		Inbound Folder text field (apart from the first one) that is left blank is treated as if the 
		checkbox above is unchecked, and that folder will not be included in the list of inbound 
		folders to check.  Duplicate folder names and nonexistant folder names are not accepted.
		If the desired folder pathname is on a remote server, prefix the pathname with a "\\"
		followed by the server's IP address.
	PDF Folders:
		Pathnames to the folders to copy merged PDF files into.  All four of these fields must be
		filled in.  Duplicate folder names are not accepted.  If the desired folder pathname is on a 
		remote server, prefix the pathname with a "\\" followed by by the server's IP address.
	Check For New Files Every:
		An amount of seconds for the timer to countdown from before a merge is run.  This field must 
		contain a positive whole number to be accepted.
	Report Status Every:
		An amount of seconds for the timer to countdown from before reporting the application's
		status to the database.  This field must contain a positive whole number to be accepted.
	Database:
		The name of the database the Attach PDF application reports to.  The database must be valid 
		to be accepted.
	
Check Boxes:
